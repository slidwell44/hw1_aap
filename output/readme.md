So I really only have two files to look out for:

1. hw1_main.ipynb
--- This is the main project file that is done completely in a jupiter notebook in visual studios. This contains all of the code that I worked on for this hw project as well as the output and some scripted comments.

2. in output, there is sweetviz_report.html because I generated one in the automated EDA section and thought output would be a good place to include this.

#---------------------------------------

Otherwise, the .ipynb file tracks with the hw directions in starting at:

- The Raw Data
- Preliminary Data Prep
- Understanding the Problem
- Task 1, where I created the project in github using the cookie cutter template
- Task 2, the version control where I made my commits to git and tracked only the files that were important to this project, making sure to exlude data files
- Task 3, this is where I included the sweetviz report along with some manual EDA on our data
- Task 4, I kind of followed along with the pump it up project and included more than what was probably necessary here, but I kept it because I thought it helped
- Task 4.5, I started with...

--- Model 0, I found a way to use the dummy model class online and it seemed to work for what we needed in order to compare back to it

--- Model 1 : Ridge Regression, I think this is where my knowledge of python and lack of statistics took over. I focused more on getting the assignment "done" rather than understanding the actual math behind it. I think this is mainly because I underestimated how long this assignment would actually take me. I would say all in all I took almost 12-16 hours give or take to complete this. I originally assumed like 1-2 so it really threw me off. I will not make that mistake for the next assignment.

--- Model 2 : Lasso w/ C=1.0, kind of more of the same, I was able to get the output that "seemed" correct, but need to still dive deeper to understand it. A lot of the comments I made were kind of vague because I'm just not really sure what I'm getting is correct.

--- Model 3 : Lasso w/ C=0.01, again, seemed to work by changing the model and updating the pipeline

--- Model 4 : Lasso w/ Optimal C Value, again, wasn't really sure if this was correct. It seemed like I followed along correctly, just comes from not diving into the math behind it enough. Like I said, I need to spend more time on HW#2.

- Task 5 : Simple Decision Tree, this one was pretty fun. It wasn't crazy difficult to do and I was able to display the fitted tree. Although I understand if it isnt incredibly visible...

- Task 6 : A little error exploration, I'm not sure if I did this right... I wasn't really sure what to do because the hints totally confused me. So I did what I thought the hints wanted me to do. Otherwise I wouldve created a model similar to models 1-4 and then im not sure where I wouldve gone
